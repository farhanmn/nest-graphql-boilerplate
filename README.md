$ npx prisma migrate deploy

# apply new prisma schema after deploy
$ npx prisma generate
```

## Compile and run the project

## Tech

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - Query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) - a next-generation objectâ€“relational mapper (ORM) that claims to help developers build faster and make fewer errors
- [Passport](https://passportjs.org/) - Authentication middleware for Node.js
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - A compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io) - A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline
